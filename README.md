# SimpleEventCalendar

This is my first code that I am writing to share to public I am still working on it still some more to do but you can feel free to pull to see where I am at right now and add your own update. 

The idea of this is to create a jQuery module with Bootstrap so that people who want to include a simple looking calendar that had events in their website using just a tag that they will add in their HTML code.

Thanks,
Sen
